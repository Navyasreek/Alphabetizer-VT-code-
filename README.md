# Alphabetizer-VT-code-
Programming exercise: Alphabetizer     Write a program that can read in a series of strings and output the strings with the characters in alphabetical order.     Capitalization does not matter for a character, but characters should be output in the same form that they were input.  e.g. P should count the same as p, but be output as P.  Non-alphabetic characters should be ignored and not included in the output string.     Examples:                         “VirginiaTech” would be output as “aceghiiinrTV”                             “3 Blind Mice” would be output as “BcdeiilMn"
